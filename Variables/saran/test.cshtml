It is considered to be the most accurate and sensitive technique of gene expression quantification. In principle, it can detect a single molecule of target mRNA present in PCR assay. Recently, this approach was found to be suitable for monitoring gene expression levels in single oocytes and eggs of the African clawed frog <em>Xenopus laevis</em>, providing a convenient experimental model for gene expression studies. Evaluation of cell-to-cell, sampling, and measurement variations of RT-qPCR revealed that biological variation had the greatest impact on gene expression quantification by this technique. A lognormal distribution of transcript levels, with a significant degree of gene expression variation among the individual oocytes, was observed in oocyte populations. Continuous monitoring transcript levels in single living oocytes and eggs, by analyzing nanoliter volumes of cytoplasmic material, revealed robust degradation of mRNA in apoptotic eggs. The apoptotic degradation began in the eggs after meiotic exit, coinciding with cytochrome C release and caspase activation, and it proceeded via endonucleolytic cleavage and deadenylation. mRNA degradation shifted significantly the expression balance between major pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic genes, generating notoriously apoptotic expression patterns. Our results highlight feasibility of low-copy mRNA quantification by the RT-qPCR-based technique and pinpoint biological variation as a major factor impeding these measurements.</span></p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;\" lang=\"EN-US\">References</span></strong></p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;\" lang=\"EN-US\">Tokmakov et al.
